 I'm an 18-year-old high school graduate with a huge passion for tech. I've been creating online shops, diving into hackathons, and getting experience with both front-end and back-end development, plus dealing with cloud computing and databases.

I'm really proud of being part of the "Notal Vision" team as a frontend developer. We're working on some special ideas. Also, I teamed up with some engineers on a recycling project. We built a mini-app that rewards you with points and coupons for local shops when you recycle.

All of this has taught me the value of hard work, sparked my creativity, and got me super pumped about learning. Right now, I'm into into ReactJS, MobX, and SSCS to make some frontend magic in Notal Vision.

Let's connect, chat about our journeys, and explore all the amazing stuff that tech has to offer!
